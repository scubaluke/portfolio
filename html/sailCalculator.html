                <p>I built and designed this sailing calculator to help other sailors narrow their search for the prefect sail boat by searching over 3000 vessel's in our database, as well as calculate various aspects of sailing.  Calculators include distance and time estimation, load and safety ratings, vessel's theoretical speed as well as sailing characteristics of.

                    Sail calculator came about when I was trying to sail 300 miles directly up wind. I was trying to figure out how to calculate the difference in time and distance it would take sailing a less acute angle to the wind. The more upwind I sailed the slower the boat would travel, however the route is a bit more direct, so less miles to sail. I was unable to find a calculator to make this calculation and had trouble even finding a formula for this. I suppose some sailors are uninterested in making these calculations and just sail onward.  I however, thirst for this knowledge in my continuing quest to learn and become the best I can be.   
                </p><p>
                    I designed this page with each calculator being held in a hidden drop down, keeping the page simpler and cleaner.  This allows users to more easily find the calculators they are looking for. Users can make calculations in imperial and metric units, results will be given in the selected units.  
                </p><p>
                     Users can select their preference "light mode" or "pirate mode". User selected preference is stored in local storage for their next visit. Modes are changed with data-theme equal to dark for pirate mode. Colors are changed with CSS variables allowing for much less CSS over all and modifications can easily be made across the site. The page also uses display flex in many places for ease of use and best display on a variety of devices, while again, using less overall CSS code.
